          Spiders are arthropods that have eight legs. They have more legs and
          different body parts than insects, and they also don’t move around in
          the same way insects do. Spiders are in the arachnid class, but not
          all arachnids are spiders. There are about 40,000 known species of
          spiders. Most spiders use a web to catch their prey, which is usually
          insects. The largest spider is the Goliath tarantula, and they can
          catch birds. The smallest spider in the world is less than 1mm long!

            Spiders are arthropods, like insects – they have an exoskeleton that
            is on the outside of their body instead of the inside (unlike
            humans).

          <li>There are around 40,000 known species of spiders.</li>
          <li>
            There are a few main differences between spiders and insects, and
            one of these is the number of legs – all spiders have eight legs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spider bodies are made up of two main parts – the cephalothorax and
            the abdomen.
          </li>
          <li>Spiders create silk from spinneret glands in their abdomen.</li>
          <li>
            Spider silk is extremely strong, and has a number of different uses.
          </li>
          <li>
            One of the ways spiders use silk is to create webs, which catch
            prey.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are a few different kinds of spider webs, such as orbs,
            funnels and sheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not all spiders catch their prey in webs – some hide and wait for
            insects to come by.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spiders lay eggs, and store them in an egg sac to keep them safe.
          </li>
